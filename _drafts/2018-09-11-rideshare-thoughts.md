#pros
- transit is unpleasant
- transit does not take directly to where i want to go
- i can hail a car from inside, and meet it at the door when it arrives
- i dont have to worry about parking
- i dont have to worry about drinking 
- lets me not have to buy + store a car
  - now each car ride has an explicit cost associated with it
  - will remain more local since will bike or walk 
- upfront consent of destination b/w customer and driver
- billing handled within the app. 
- route is being explicited logged by a central service that can be referred to if something goes wrong
- some sort of system that removes bad apples...
- bringing death and distruction upon entrentched cartels

#cons
- costs more than transit
- transit move more people efficiently for heavily trafficed routes
- transit (location + route dependant) will have a right of way through either a special lane, grade separated tracks, or completely separate tracks
- getting an uber at the airport is hell...
- current implementations leave something to be desired (mounds of bad press for urber, lyft doing same but less poisoned than uber)
- bit scarry to be around the drivers while on a bike
- having an aggressive + experienced cabby can be pretty fun
