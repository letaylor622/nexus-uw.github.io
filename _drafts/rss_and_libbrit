https://github.com/trashhalo/reddit-rss/pull/36

allows redditt-rss to serve as an improved rss feed that links to https://libredd.it/ (simple and lightweight reddit UI)

why not teddit's rss support?
1. they serve up the same limited reddit rss items
2. i have found the teddit pages to take a while to load'
3. i do not have any need to interact with reddit, so the js is completely unessary to me
