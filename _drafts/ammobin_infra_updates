using cloudflare workers + nuxt 3
no more s3 static generate bucket
todo: restore url params 
waiting for more nuxt dev work
 seeing rough egdes around handling 404 in worker

remove aws lambda from customer traffic
ran up large aws bill due to number of lambda invokes
	switched to fly.io
	considered cloudflare workers BUT not easy lift and shift (unable to run hapi in worker env)
	first pass done with image proxy
  have fly.io send metrics directly to selfhosted es cluster 


todo:
	CD cloudflare workers + fly.io
