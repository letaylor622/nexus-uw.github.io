# what 
a clientside encrypted note sharing webapp. built with php7, Lumen, sqlite, rollup, and docker.

# why 
I wanted a selfhosted secure note sharing site for myself to send text between my computers. Existing sites either wanted too much infrastructure or did not provide a docker container. Some additional people had created docker containers for the projects, but they were not being updated with the latest application code. 
 
Also i wanted something to do at this time after the big [ammobin AWS migration](https://ramsay.xyz/2020/02/02/ammobin-now-runs-on-aws-withou-any-servers.html)

# where 
it is currently hosted over at [https://mokintoken.ramsay.xyz](https://mokintoken.ramsay.xyz/?ref=release_post)

the code is available under the UNLICENSE at https://github.com/nexus-uw/mokintoken
