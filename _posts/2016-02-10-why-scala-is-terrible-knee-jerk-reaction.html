Yesterday, I spent a great deal of time trying to get a simple script that hits one GET endpoint, does a quick filter on the results, and then sends a POST request to a different service. Both of these services have Scala libraries for their APIs but I could never manage to import and make a basic request.<br /><br />So after 6 hours of failing to do anything, I gave up, learned the basics of Go, and within 3 hours I implemented the basics my idea.<br /><br />From this experience, I have come up with the following guidelines for what makes a programing language accessible<br />- can create a single file program that does something marginally useful<br />- simple dependency management for 3rd party libs<br />- basic install + run on the command line (I don't care to download some 400MB IDE to create a shell script)<br /><br />=&gt; so Python, Node/JavaScript, and Go are the prime candidates for accessible programming languages (what a shocker...)
